# funthreads
A simple library that provides an abstraction for the Node.js worker_threads module. ðŸ”¥

You can run your function in a dedicated thread by working with Promises. This library presents a simple tool that takes a task function as its parameter, orchestrates its execution in a new thread, and subsequently delivers a Promise. Within the confines of this task function, you retain the freedom to furnish either a Promise or an unprocessed value (ranging from objects to strings, and more).

Furthermore, this library seamlessly integrates with Async/Await and TypeScript for an elevated development experience.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i funthreads
```

## Example

This example demonstrates the optimization of two resource-intensive calculations through parallel execution in distinct threads.
By distributing the tasks across separate threads, significant time savings are achieved.

```javascript
import executeInThread from 'funthreads';

async function calculate() {
    const values = await Promise.all([
        executeInThread(() => 2 ** 10),
        
        executeInThread(() => 3 ** 10)
    ]);
    
    console.log(values);
}

calculate();
```

**Surprisingly simple, isn't it?**

## API

### `executeInThread(task, ...params)`
Execute a function in a thread.

#### Parameters
*Task (Function)*: The function to be executed in a thread.
*...params (any)*: Additional arguments to be passed to the Task function.

The `executeInThread` function allows you to execute a given task function in a dedicated thread, similar to the behavior of `setTimeout` or `setInterval`. You provide the main function to be executed, along with any additional arguments (...args) that should be passed to the given function.

#### Returns
*Promise<any>*: A Promise that resolves with the return value of the callback.

Inside the provided function, you have the flexibility to return any value, including a Promise. The returned value, whether it's a standard value or a Promise, will be passed back to you as the resolved result of the `Promise` returned by the `executeInThread` function.

#### Important

Access to data outside of the task function is restricted. If you require the use of a module, it should be required within the task function. The sole method for accessing data within a task function from external sources is through the utilization of the parameters. Closures do not function in this context.

#### Example

In this example, we're reading a file in a separate thread and returning the data in string format. We start by defining a task function that will run within the thread, and then we prepare the necessary parameters to be passed as inputs to that function.

```javascript
import executeInThread from 'funthreads';

// this will be executed in a dedicated thread
async function task(fileName) {
    // Closure doesn't work here
    const { writeFile } = require('fs/promises');

    await writeFile(fileName, 'Hello from a thread!');
}

const fileName = 'thread.txt';

async function read() {
    const content = await executeInThread(task, fileName);
    
    console.log(content);
}

read();
```
